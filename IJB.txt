"SELECTION MODE in the file list isnt properly behaving I want it to be better:
1. The initial long press of thefile will select the file and if another file is normal pressed it selects that file and therefore adding it to the selection.(JUST LIKE IN CATEGORY LIST). So the normal press of a file in selection mode has a different behavior compared to a normal press while selection mode is off.
2. Once selection mode of the file list is on the actions like saving the file using the save icon/button on each file or opening the file are all disabled.(JUST LIKE IN CATEGORY LIST, WHERE YOU CANT OPEN A CATEGORY OR TOOGLE THE CHECKMARK OF A CATEGORY ONCE SELECTION MODE IS ON)
3. The selection of a file highlights/adds a checkmark to the file that is selected to visually represent its selection.This highlighting should be in realtime and not laggy/buggy. Immidiately a file is selected it is highlighted it is unhighilighted immidiately the file is unselected. When I select a file I can still open another file(in the file viewer) or save a file using the saving icon which are alll actions taht are not supposed to be able to happen when selection mode is on.
4. If only one file is selected and the user normal pressess on that same file, the user will then have unselected the file.Therefore there will be no file selected.If a user presses the select all button and then presses the invert button it also means there is no selection of a file that has been made. In both of these cases, where no selection is made this means that the selection mode is turned off.(jUST LIKE IT IS IN THE CATEGORY LIST)
5. The save option in the menu of the selectionmode should work just as the save in the file viewer works but only this time it can batch save these files.yOU CAN JUST MAKE THE SAVE ICON DISAPPEAR WHEN SELECTION MODE IS ON


NOTE:DONT UNNECESSARILY REMOVE/CHANGE ANY FEATURE OR UI UX COMPONENT. AND BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE CODEBASE FOR CONTEX OF HOW THIS FILE LIST WORKS. FOCUS ON EXPO MANAGED WORKFLOW AND NOT AN EJECTED VERSION OF THIS APP.
before you make changes briefly tell me what you understand about this prompt(ie what I want you to do) and ask me any questions incase a point I made was abit ambigous or ununderstandable, then I will okay your continued editting of the code"

1. batch save functionality should work exactly like individual saves but with many files .But overally just follow best practice.
2. For the "When in selection mode, should the file list items still show their metadata (size, date, etc.) or should the view simplify" if it would significantly affect the performance then you should also simplify the information but if not just let it remain the same as it is.
3. there should be visual indicator at the top of the list showing how many files are currently selected just as it is right now

DONT UNNECESSARILY REMOVE/CHANGE ANY FEATURE OR UI UX COMPONENT. AND BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES .
GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE CODEBASE(WHICH YOU HAVE ACCESS OF SO DONT TELL ME SOMETHING LIKE "I'll need to see the relevant code files")FOR CONTEX OF HOW THIS FILE LIST WORKS. FOCUS ON EXPO MANAGED WORKFLOW AND NOT AN EJECTED VERSION OF THIS APP.

OTHERWISE PROCEED"
