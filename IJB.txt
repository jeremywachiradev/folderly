Since I have now switched to development build, Can you make sure the metadata(specifically the date and size of the file) shown on both the file viewer screen and the file list to actually be accurate. Currently I am defaulting to using the app to register these files and the files will be dated according to the date they were registered in my app.However since this is not actually the actual date of the file make sure the metadata of the appp is correct. 
BEFORE YOU START GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE APP FOR MORE CONTEXT.DONT TOUCH OTHER PARTS OF THE PROJECT THAT HAVE NO RELATION TO THIS FEATURE. ALSO DONT CHANGE THE UI UX OF ANYTHING.

create an easter egg for the app where like in android when one presses ta couple of times on the android version it enables the developer mode but in my app it would show my card as the developer and it would be an image that is really cool and have animations. This will appear as though it is a top layer to the screen and the background is blurred so that the user can see the card.Then the user can press the sides or press the native back button to close the card.All of this will happen when the user triple presses on the " Made in Kenya with ❤️ by Jerira" text.And on first press it gives the small hint that there is something hidden and they should press again to see the card, it will be a small hint and on second press the hint says one more time just like enabling developer mode on android.
